# TwoChunkCarverReversal
Code for reversing a pair of carver seeds and the desired offset between the two chunks (on a single axis, either x or z) into a list of world seeds and coordinates at which such carver seeds can be found.

An explanation of the algorithm can be found in `cpp/two_carver_reversal.cpp`.

For a usage example, see `cpp/example.cpp`.
